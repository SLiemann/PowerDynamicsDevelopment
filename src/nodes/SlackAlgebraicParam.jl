```Julia
SlackAlgebraic(;U)
```

A node type that locally fixes the complex voltage (``U``) of the node.

As the complex voltage can be represented as ``U=Ve^{i\phi}``, this is equivlant
to fixing the voltage magnitude ``V`` and the angle ``\phi``.

# Keyword Arguments
- `U`: the complex voltage

# Mathematical Representation
Using `SlackAlgebraic` for node ``a`` applies the equation
```maths
0 = U_a - u_a.
```
