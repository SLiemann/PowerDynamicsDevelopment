```

A node type that applies the 6th-order (sometimes also called 4th-order if ω and δ are not counted)
synchronous machine model which is implemented according to
F. Milano, "Power System Modelling and Scripting", Springer Verlag, 2010
The main equations are on page 331, cf. Table 15.2 Model 6.b

Also the model includes an Automatic Voltage Regulator and Overexcitation Limiter (OEL) from (see Fig. 2.6).
PES Technical Report 19 : "Test Systems for Voltage Stability Analysis and Security Assessment", 2015.

The model has the following internal dynamic variables:
* ``u`` is here an algebraic constraint
* ``e_ds`` transient magnetic state in d-axis
* ``e_qs`` transient magnetic state in q-axis
* ``e_dss`` subtransient magnetic state in d-axis
* ``e_qss`` subtransient magnetic state in q-axis
* ``ω`` representing the frequency of the rotator (not relative)
* ``θ`` representing the angle of the rotor with respect to the voltage angle ``ϕ``
* ``ifd`` field current - algebraic constraint.
* ``Timer`` Timer inside OEL.
* ``x1`` state inside transient gain reduction (PDT1).
* ``E_f`` Field voltage, output of Exciter.
